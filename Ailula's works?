# Story (feed up the sheep) (forgive me if I did wrong, please!)
# I realize I plagiarised, it is bad.

# Goal:
    There is food inside the basket that besides the sheep, if it feels hungry, feeds until it gets full in seventy-hundredth.

# There is someone to feed it.
pygame.draw.shape = someone()
    feed the sheep if it feels hungry.

# THis is the appearance of the basket.
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 400, 400
# Colour:
    Brown == full of the basket.
There is full food in it.

# The levels of sheep's hungry: = 0 == no hungry; <= 7 == somewhat hungry; >7, <= 10 == very hungry
    if sheep hungry = 0:
        print("nothing out from basket")
    elif sheep hungry <= 5:
        print("a bit of foods out from the basket")
    elif sheep hungry <= 7:
        print("some food out from the basket")
    else sheep hungry >7, <=10:
        print("lots of food out from the basket")
